The goal:

Provide a webpage that:
    * Lists all running nova instances
    * Can spawn a new nova instance with the click of the button:
        * Starts a cloud server
        * Pulls down and runs auto.sh a la http://cloudbuilders.github.com/deploy.sh/hacking-nova.html
        * resets down to a single instance at 6am each day
        * make latest.futurestack.org always point to the first nova instance

Later:
    Provide some means of accessing the servers at console (maybe ajaxterm, maybe root password, maybe some combination).  Maybe root password could be encrypted via blowfish using a key stored in conf file and stored as metadata via servers api.
